    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 1, 2026</p>

    <p>At <strong>Gaze Guard</strong>, we believe that your privacy is a fundamental human right. Our application is designed to protect your on-screen data from prying eyes without compromising your personal information.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>🚨 Summary</h3>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data.</strong> All face tracking and detection processes are performed 100% locally on your device (offline).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Gaze Guard does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, share, or transmit any personal information, images, or video feeds. We do not have servers, and we do not use third-party analytics tools that track user behavior.</p>

    <h2>2. Camera Usage & Apple Vision Framework</h2>
    <p>To function properly, Gaze Guard requires access to your Mac's camera. This access is used strictly for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detecting where you are looking (Gaze Detection).</li>
        <li>Detecting if someone else is looking at your screen (Shoulder Surfing Detection).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This process utilizes Apple's <strong>Vision Framework</strong> entirely on-device. The video feed is processed in real-time memory (RAM) and is never saved to a disk or sent to the cloud.</p>

    <h2>3. TrueDepth API</h2>
    <p>If your device supports it, we may use TrueDepth API data solely for improving the accuracy of face tracking. This data is discarded instantly after the calculation is complete.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any data, we have no data to share with third parties, advertisers, or marketing agencies.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via our support page.</p>
