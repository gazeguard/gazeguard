    "faq_a1": "<strong>Absolutely not.</strong> Gaze Guard is 100% offline. All processing happens locally on your Mac using Apple's Vision framework. We do not collect, store, or transmit any data whatsoever.",
    "faq_q2": "Is my camera feed safe? Has Apple reviewed this?",
    "faq_a2": "Yes. Gaze Guard has passed Apple's strict App Store review guidelines regarding privacy and security. Your camera feed is analyzed in real-time inside your Mac's RAM and is <strong>never</strong> recorded or saved to your disk.",
    "faq_q3": "I opened the app but can't see the icon in the Menu Bar. Where is it?",
    "faq_a3": "If you are using a MacBook with a camera \"notch\" at the top of the screen, the Gaze Guard icon might be hidden behind it due to macOS automatically hiding overflow icons. To fix this, simply close some other menu bar apps, or hold down the <strong>Command (⌘)</strong> key and drag the Gaze Guard icon to the right side of the notch so it stays visible.",
    "faq_q4": "Is this a subscription or a one-time purchase?",
    "faq_a4": "Gaze Guard is a <strong>lifetime, one-time purchase</strong>. You pay once and get lifetime access to all current features with zero recurring subscription fees.",
    "faq_q5": "Will it drain my Mac's battery?",
